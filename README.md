Airbnb is a community online service for people to advertise, discover and book accommodation and lodges.

Airbnb allows individuals to rent all or part of their own home as a form of extra accommodation. The website provides a search and booking platform between the person offering the accommodation and the tourist looking for the location. It covers more than 500,000 advertisements in more than 35,000 cities and 192 countries. Since its creation in November 2008 until June 2012, more than 10 million reservations have been booked via Airbnb.

 If you decide to rent your house, apartment or just share a room, you need to base yourself on the rent amount upon the average price for the site. But how is it possible to get nearly close to the price it should be just based on the Airbnb data? Predictions!

 Using a dataset from Airbnb it's possible to collect important informations, so, in this prediction I've choosen a way to extract these informations based in a plain person that want to rent a place with average low price.
